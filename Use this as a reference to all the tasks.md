Use this as a reference to all the tasks.
I'll give you a list of exercises, and you'll add them to the same git repo I mentioned earlier in the chat.
You'll name the JavaScript, or HTML programs accordingly:
Tehtävä.{The number of the task (1 for example)}.(js/html)
Task 2: 
Write a program that prompts for user's name and then greets the user. Print the result to the HTML document: Hello, Name! (2p)
Task 3:


Write a program that prompts for three integers. The program prints the sum, product and average of the numbers to the HTML document. (3p)

    remember to convert strings to numbers when adding them together.

task 4:

In the Harry Potter children's books, the sorting hat assigns a new student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to one of the four classes, which are Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw. Write an electronic sorting hat that asks for a student's name and draws a room for that student. If you enter Anna as the name, for example, the program prints to the HTML document "Anna, you are Ravenclaw." (3p)

    Use math.random() to draw a value (1, 2, 3 or 4)
    Once the number is drawn, you need to use a multiple choice structure (if, else if, ..., else or switch).

task 7:


Write a program that rolls user defined number of dice and displays the sum of the results of the dice rolls.(2p)

    First, program asks the user for the number of dice rolls.
    Then the program throws a die as many times as the user defined.
    Print the sum of the results in the console or in the HTML document.
